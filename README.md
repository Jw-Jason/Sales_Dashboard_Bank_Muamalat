# Sales Dashboard Bank Muamalat

This repository serves as the documentation for a project collaboration with Bank Muamalat. The objective is to develop a Looker Studio dashboard that transforms fragmented raw data into clear, actionable insights, enabling the company to drive data-driven growth and strategic decision-making.

## 1. Data Preparation 💻

Executed data consolidation of multiple disparate CSV files using Google BigQuery. I designed a relational schema by joining datasets on their respective primary keys, resulting in a comprehensive Master Data file `Master Data.csv` optimized for further analysis and visualization.

## 2. Creating Dasboard With Lookerstudio 📲

Following the creation of the master data, I developed a comprehensive dashboard incorporating tables, charts, and scorecards to summarize the key findings. The finalized visualization is available in the document: `Sales Dashboard Bank Muamalat Jason Williem Candra.pdf`.

## 3. Creating Report 📕

inalized the project by delivering a strategic presentation that bridges technical data processes with actionable business outcomes. The report outlines key recommendations based on dashboard trends to optimize future performance and increase market competitiveness.
